It quantifies reliability by comparing observed agreement to the agreement expected by chance. A higher \u03ba value indicates stronger agreement, impacting the results by determining the number of annotators needed for reliable outcomes. In this case, with 5 annotators and a threshold of 0.95, \u03ba achieved was 0.58, indicating moderate to substantial agreement, which suggests a balance between cost-efficiency and reliability in annotation decisions."
